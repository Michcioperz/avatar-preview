this tries really hard to implement roughly what [edent/AvatarPreview](https://github.com/edent/AvatarPreview) does but without javascript

it results in the file being send to server and then back but at least it doesn't do weird stuff in browser

actually it does weird stuff in browser cause all the server does is make the image into a base64 string, the rest is just css
